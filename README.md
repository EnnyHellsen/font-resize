### Project

This project is using [textFit.js](https://github.com/STRML/textFit)

It might be an unnecessary big library to be used for smaller use cases, but it works well in this scenario. A simpler javascript function and/or the unit `vw` (view-width) can be used to size text with no height restrictions.
