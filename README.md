### Project

This project is using [textFit.js](https://github.com/STRML/textFit).

I wanted to solve this by creating my own function, but the result was not working perfectly so instead I decided to use the textFit library. 

This might be an unnecessary big library to be used for smaller use cases, but it works well in this scenario. A simpler javascript function and/or the unit `vw` (view-width) can be used to size text with less restrictions.
